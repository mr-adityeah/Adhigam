Our initiative is centred on youth, and we not only support Software Open Sourcing, but we also support Hardware Open Sourcing.

Any user who comes to our site may look for projects in his or her field and contribute to them after passing via the Project Dashboard, which allows any student or university to market their project.
They can also publicise their initiative and engage with others in order to solicit contributions.

After communicating with the owner directly or via the platform's Global Project chat tool after joining up, students can examine it and contribute to it.

The solution also supports project plagiarism and individual recognition, as well as keeping the user/community engaged via the programmes tab.
